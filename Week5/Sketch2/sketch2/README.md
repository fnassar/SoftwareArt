## Inspiration
I was inspired by the sign wave we saw in class for this sketch, I found it really interesting and facinating so I wanted to play around with it. by changing some stuff and adding to it i created something new!
## Describtion
For this sketch, I used the same circles he used to draw the animation. I, however, replaced some of the sign functions he used by noise functions for the motion of the line. instead of having the noise only on the x valueor the y value, i put it on both but with different rates of change so that the motion is not just back and forth from a point. 
I kept the size controle with the sin functions because I prefered the transition of the sizes than the random one the noise function offered.
I used noise to control the color as well. I used HSB color palette so changeing the color was easy using the Hue value of Hsb colors. I also allowed the user to control the color saturation using gui, because I like pastel colors but not everyone is the same, so i wanted the user to have control.
