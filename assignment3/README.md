# Assignment 1: Animation

## Description
For this assignment, I used ofBox2d library to create an interactive animation where the user can press on keyboard keys 1-7 to play a simple tune using the do, re, me, fa, so, la, si sounds. As the user plays the sound, shapes of different colors apear on the screen and fall to the bottom on the screen.

## Algorithm
- The first thing I did was create 2dBox classes where i assign a sound, color and dimentions to the shape. 
- I created 2 

```

```

This was made to restart the starting color from the array after 5 shapes are drawn. *shapes*. This was finally followed by the `gui.draw()` function and we added a few lines to take screenshots when the `'s'` *key* is pressed and ran the code.

## Sample Output
